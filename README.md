# minor_project
working version with basic UI only
changes: all code in a single file
a very basic UI implemented using open_file() function. This code open up a UI with a start button only, and on clicking the start button, turns on the camera. If it 
recognizes a face, it will mark the name and time of that face in a csv file.
problems : addition of new user not working
           UI is too basic and ugly
